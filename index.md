There seems to be little consensus as to the lengths of rivers in published sources, nor much agreement as to what constitutes a river. Thus the River Ure / River Ouse can be counted as one river system or two rivers. If it is counted as one, the River Aire / Yorkshire Ouse / Humber system would come fourth in the list, with a combined length of 161 miles (259Â km).
